This project aims to predict the price of a car based on various features such as year, fuel type, transmission, seller type, etc., using machine learning regression models. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and fed into different regression algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

ðŸ›  Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Encoding categorical variables

Feature selection

Model training using:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Model evaluation using RÂ² Score and RMSE
